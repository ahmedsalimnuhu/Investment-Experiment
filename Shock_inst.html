        <p> <h5> Instructions/Rules: Please read carefully </h5> </p>
 <ul>
        <li> Under this scenario <font color="blue"> your partner is another CoP member at
            this meeting, but you will never know each others’ identities. </font> </li>
     <li> <b> Like the previous game </b> both P1 and P2 each start with {{Constants.endowment}} </li> <p></p>
      <li> <font color="red"> But in this round, there is a 50-50 chance that the computer will either triple the
          amount P1 sends to P2, or turn it to 0. </font> Whatever amount P2 receives, P2 will
          then decide how much of it to send back to P1.
</li> <p></p>

     <li> <b> If P2 receives 0, P2 will not know whether the computer turned P1’s investment into 0, or
         whether P1 sent 0 to P2.
         If P2 receives some positive amount, P2 will know that P1 sent one third of this
         amount and that the computer tripled the amount P1 sent.
     </b></li>
 </ul>
