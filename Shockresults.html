        You had {{Constants.endowment}} from the investor and you sent {{ group.sent_amount }} to P2 leaving you with
        {{less_endowment}}. The computer either turned this to zero or tripled it for P2. Then P2 returned {{ group.sent_back_amount }} back to you. <p></p>

<b> Therefore, <u> your total payoff for this round  is {{ player.payoff }} </u> </b>
which is the sum of the {{ group.sent_back_amount }} P2 returned to you plus the {{less_endowment}} you were left with.

       You had {{Constants.endowment}} from the investor and P1 sent you some amount which was randomly changed
    by the computer to become {{random_amount}}.  Therefore you had a total of {{total_random}} in your account.
    You then sent {{ group.sent_back_amount }} back to P1.

    <p></p>

<b> Therefore, <u> your total payoff for this round  is {{ player.payoff }} </u> </b>
which is the {{total_random}} you had minus the {{ group.sent_back_amount }} you sent back to P1.
