        <p> <h5> INSTRUCTIONS </h5> </p>
      <ul>
          <li> In this part we will ask you to make a number of  decisions about investing
           money by sending it to a partner.  In each of these decisions, you will either play as
           Player P1 or Player P2. </li> <p></p>
<b> <font color="blue">  <li> The investment decisions will be in a currency called “Token” or TK for short.
    To determine your final payoffs, we will convert each token to KSH 100.
    In other words, the exchange rate is TK 1 = KSH 100. </li> </font> </b> <p></p>
<li> For each decision, you will be faced with a unique situation where you will have
    {{Constants.endowment}} from an investor to support your business. </li> <p></p>
        <li> Each decision you will be asked to make will be slightly different from any of the other decisions.</li>
        <li>  The decisions you make will determine your final payoff.</li>
        <p></p>
<li> At the end of all the three parts of this study, to determine your payment from Part II,
    <b> <font> <font color="red"> we will randomly select one of the decisions you would have made either as P1 or P2. </font></u></b> </li> <p></p>
<li><b> Note that each of these decisions has an equal chance of being selected. So, make
    every decision carefully. </li> </div>
