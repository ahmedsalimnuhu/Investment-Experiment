        <p> <h5> Instructions/Rules: Please read carefully </h5> </p>
 <ul>
        <li> Under this scenario <font color="red"> your partner is another CoP member at
            this meeting, but you will never know each others’ identities. </font> </li>
     <li> <b> Like the previous game </b> both P1 and P2 each start with TK.10 and
            any amount P1 sends to P2 will be tripled </li> <p></p>
        <li> In addition, <font color="red"> <b> P1 can request back any amount from P2,
            as long as it is not more than the tripled amount P2 will
            receive from P1.</b> </font>  Even though P1 can request some money,
            P2 can send less than the amount P1 requests.
 </li><p></p>
<li> If P2 sends the entire amount P1 requests, then P1 will receive that amount and P2 will keep any amount remaining.
  </li>
<li> But if P2 sends to P1 back any amount less than what P1 requests,
    <font color="red"> then there is a 50% chance that P2 will be fined </font> for not
    complying with
    the requested amount. Here’s how it works:<b>The computer will flip a coin. If
    the computer coin lands on heads, P1 will receive back only what P2
        decided to send P1 and P2 will keep the remaining amount. </b>
 </li>
<li><b> <font color="blue"> If the computer coin lands on tails, then the computer will send
    P1 back the entire amount P1 requested.</b> </font> In addition, the computer
    will take an extra <font color="red"> <b>  {{ Constants.other_fine }} </b> </font>
    from P2 as a fine.
    This fine of
     <font color="red"> <b>  {{ Constants.other_fine }} </b> </font>  will be returned
    to the research study account and no player will receive this
    <font color="red"> <b>  {{ Constants.other_fine }} </b> </font>
 </li>
 </ul>
