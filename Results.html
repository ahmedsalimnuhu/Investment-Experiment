        You had {{Constants.endowment}} from the investor and you sent {{ group.sent_amount }} to P2 leaving you with
        {{less_endowment}}.
        This was tripled for P2 so P2 received {{tripled_amount}}.
        Then P2 returned {{ group.sent_back_amount }} back to you. <p></p>

<b> Therefore, <u> your total payoff for this round  is {{ player.payoff }} </u> </b>
which is the sum of the {{ group.sent_back_amount }} P2 returned to you plus the {{less_endowment}} you were left with.

       You had {{Constants.endowment}} from the investor and P1 sent you {{ group.sent_amount }} which was tripled to become {{tripled_amount}}.
    Therefore you had a total of {{total_amount}} in your account. You then sent {{ group.sent_back_amount }} back to P1.
    </p>
<p></p>

<b> Therefore, <u> your total payoff for this round  is {{ player.payoff }} </u> </b>
which is the {{total_amount}} you had minus the {{ group.sent_back_amount }} you sent back to P1.
